							      			<h3>LIABILITY DISCLOSURE </h3>
							      			<p>Son-Tours, Inc., and staff act only in the capacity of agents for the passengers in all matters pertaining to hotel accommodations, sightseeing tours and transportation whether by railroad, motorcoach, or plane, and as such, they shall not be liable for any injury, personal injury, damage, loss, accident, delay, or irregularity which may be occasioned either by reason of any company or person engaged in conveying the passenger, or in carrying out the arrangements of the tour, or otherwise in connection therewith. </p>
							      			<p>Son-Tours reserves seats with most major carriers. (The passenger contract in use by each airline, when issued, shall constitute the sole contract between the airline and the purchaser of the tour.) In cases where seating demand deems it necessary, Son-Tours does reserve the right to use charter flights. Due to available flight routings, we cannot guarantee non-stop flights. Because of space availability and sizes of available aircraft, we cannot guarantee that members of a group will all fly together on the same flight. In rare cases, groups may have an additional overnight due to flight space availability, routings, and legal connection times. Son-Tours cannot be held responsible for changes in scheduling that airlines make, and does not take responsibility for any layovers due to these airline changes, or weather-related delays. </p>
							      			<p>In the interest of giving students the most time possible on their tour, Son-Tours will attempt to secure the earliest flights available. In the case of a lost ticket, the participant is solely responsible for meeting the airline's requirements (both logistical and financial) for ticket replacement. In cases of unforeseen disaster, all tours will be completed unless otherwise directed by the Department of State. </p>

We also reserve the right to change the dates of your tour if outside agents are unavailable such as airlines or motorcoach vendors without penalty to Son-Tours. If Son-Tours changes your dates, you will be notified within 30 days of signing your contract. Any participant who can not make the tour due to the date changes will be offered a full refund, less a $50 administration fee.
